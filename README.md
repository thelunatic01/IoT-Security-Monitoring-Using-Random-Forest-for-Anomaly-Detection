# IoT Security Monitoring: Anomaly Detection with Enhanced Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview
This project implements an **IoT Security Monitoring System** that detects anomalies in IoT network traffic using a **Random Forest** machine learning model. The system provides real-time monitoring through a **Streamlit dashboard**, offers visual insights into the detected anomalies, and includes actionable recommendations for addressing potential threats.

## Features
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection**: Processes IoT network traffic data and identifies anomalies instantly.
- **Detailed Visualizations**: 
  - Bar chart for anomaly types.
  - Pie chart for anomaly distribution.
- **Actionable Insights**:
  - Provides a summary of total anomalies detected.
  - Lists anomaly types along with recommendations for mitigation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
